            Hi there. This is a nifty little website i've made to showcase the 
            various projects I have made in my time. Most projects are related <br>
            to either computer science or engineering, two area's of interest
            for me. <del>Only some</del> None of these are truly complete, <br>
            but many were valuable learning experiences, and as such I have 
            decided that they belong here as well.
        </p>
