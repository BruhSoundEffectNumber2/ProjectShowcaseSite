                For my 8th-grade science class, our teacher tasked my group and me 
                with creating a scale model of the solar system. We were required 
                to have physical objects to represent the sun and all the main planets 
                at roughly the correct distances from the sun. 

                <br><br>

                When brainstorming what to do, I had the idea of making a model that 
                could rotate the planets around the sun. Maybe it could have the speed 
                be slow down for planets that are further from the sun.
