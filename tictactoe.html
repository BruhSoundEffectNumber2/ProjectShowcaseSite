                This is one of the first complete projects I made with Java for a 
                computer science course at my high school. This project served as 
                my first real introduction to more complicated Java development, as
                well as the use of Swing to create a GUI for the user to interact 
                with.

                The game is simple; Each player enters their name for the leaderboard, then take
                turn's placing x's or o's on the board until there is a winner or a draw. After
                the game is over, the leaderboard will be updated and saved to a file. Player's
                will be able to play again or close the game.

                The first thing I did was the ever-wonderfull process of creating classes.
                For a game like TicTacToe, I created Game, Board, Space, Player, and
                DisplayManager. I wanted to focus on the logic of the game itself. So
                I decided to make the game work on the command line first. Within
                about a day of work, the game was playable through the command line.
                It was time to give my project a fresh coat of paint.

                Swing is a Java library that is designed for created interactive
                apps. Swing was a major challenge for me, partly because of my
                inexperience with it, but also because of Swing's limits and design.
                <br><br>
                For the sake of simplicity, I made the Game class control
                the hierarchy of Swing components. The Space class is itself
                a button that the player clicks on to mark it. In a larger
                project, I would have kept the DisplayManager class around
                to manage the complexity of a GUI.

                After I finished with Swing, I wanted to do more with the project, 
                make something unique out of it. To that end, I decided that 
                adding a leaderboard would be a good goal. Implementing a leaderboard
                presented a number of new requirements, the two biggest being saving
                a user's score to a text file and displaying a sorted ranking of all
                users and their score.
                <br><br>
                When the game starts, the players are asked for their names. This
                information is saved in the Player class and is then use to find 
                any matching names in the leaderboard file, which will then update
                their score.

                <br><br>
                Code showing this in action.

                <br><br>
                When a score is updated, an issue I encountered was changing the 
                position of the player's score as seen on the screen. Swing is very
                difficult to work with when it comes to manually setting the position
                of a component. The way the leaderboard was set up, components were 
                added in order of the player's score. The parent component automatically
                showed them in a vertical grid, giving a clean list of values.

                <br><br>
                Code showing the setup of this vertical grid.

                <br><br>
                After some thinking, I came to a workable, if somewhat impractical 
                solution. Just delete all the components and create them all from 
                scratch again. Ideally this would never be done, as destroying and
                creating something from scratch is a relatively time-consuming
                process, but it was easy, clear, and good enough for the project.
                There is no point in overcomplicating something for the sake of
                it being more efficient in a different use-case.
