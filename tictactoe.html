                This project is one of the first complete tasks I made with Java 
                for a computer science course at my high school. This project 
                served as my first real introduction to more complicated Java 
                development. In addition to the use of Swing to create a GUI 
                for the user to interact with.

                The game is simple; Each player enters their name for the leaderboard, then takes
                turn's placing x's or o's on the board until there is a winner or a draw. After
                the game is over, the leaderboard will be updated and saved to a file. Players
                will be able to play again or close the game.

                The first thing I did was the ever-wonderful process of creating classes.
                For a game like TicTacToe, I created Game, Board, Space, Player, and
                DisplayManager. I wanted to focus on the logic of the game itself. So
                I decided to make the game work on the command line first. With
                a day of work, the game was playable using the command line.
                It was time to give my project a fresh coat of paint.

                Swing is a Java library designed for creating interactive apps. 
                Swing was a challenge for me, partly because of my inexperience 
                with Swing. But also because of Swing's limits and design.
                <br><br>
                For simplicity, I made the Game class control the hierarchy of 
                Swing components. The Space class is a button that the player 
                clicks on to mark it. In a larger project, I would have kept 
                the DisplayManager class around to manage the complexity of a GUI.

                After I finished with Swing, I wanted to do more with the project 
                and make something unique out of it. To that end, I decided that 
                adding a leaderboard would be a good goal. Implementing a leaderboard 
                presented many new requirements, the two largest being saving a user's score 
                to a text file and displaying a sorted ranking of all users and their scores.
                <br><br>
                When the game starts, the players give their names. This information is saved 
                in the Player class, then used to find any matching names in the leaderboard 
                file, which will then update their score.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="code-bg">
            <pre><code>
Game.java:

private void getPlayerName(Player p) {
    while (true) {
        String input = (String)JOptionPane.showInputDialog(
            mainFrame, 
            "Player " + p.visualID + ". What is your name? (Max 6 letters)",
            "Enter Your Name"
        );

        if (input == null) {
            System.exit(1);
        }

        if (input.length() > 0 && input.length() <= 6) {
            p.name = input;
            break;
        }
    }
}                        
            </code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="centered-flex-half">
            <p>
                When a score is updated, an issue I encountered was changing the position 
                of the player's score as seen on the screen. Swing is difficult to use when 
                it comes to manually setting the location of a component. The way the 
                leaderboard is set up, the components are added in order of the player's score. 
                The parent component automatically shows them in a vertical grid, giving a clean 
                list of values.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="code-bg">
            <pre><code>
Leaderboard.java:

// Remove and then re-add the scores to the leaderboard, so it will display correctly
for (LeaderboardScore score : scores) {
    remove(score);
}
for (LeaderboardScore score : scores) {
    add(score);
    score.updateText();
}
            </code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="centered-flex-half">
            <p>
                After some thinking, I came to a workable, if impractical solution. Just delete 
                all the components and create them all from scratch again. Ideally, this would 
                never happen, as destroying and creating something from scratch is a relatively 
                time-consuming process, but it was easy, clear, and good enough for the project. 
                There is no point in overcomplicating something when it isn't needed.
